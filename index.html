                <p>Game of Apps is a program that guides high school students through the whole process of building apps from beginning to end. Local professional designers and developers mentor the students weekly and teach them how to use the same tools, techniques and processes as used by the industry while the students learn to build mobile apps.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The 24-week program culminates with the student teams pitching their apps and demoing to a panel of judges. The top teams from each school district will go on to compete against other school districts for the provincial titles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Season 3 of Game of Apps will start in the near future and will be run concurrently in five school districtsâ€”Vancouver, Richmond, New Westminster, West Vancouver, North Vancouver.</p>
